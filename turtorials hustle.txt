 1.How can you list all files in a directory, with the most recent one displayed last?

As: I go to the terminal write the command ls -lt -r
       adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ ls -lt -r

2. How can you display the first 25 lines of a file? How can you display for 16 through 25?

AS: I go on the terminal to the directory where the file is saved by changing directory (cd) and then  use the   command 'head -25 filename'. My file is in the directory /home/adila/PythonClass/classnotes and the file name is tut1.py. The command is as follows: 
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ 
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ cd /home/adila/PythonClass/classnotes
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/PythonClass/classnotes$
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/PythonClass/classnotes$ head -25 tut1.py

From 16 through 25, I use tail -10 along with head -25 because counting 10 lines from the bottom ends at line 16, the following command gives that.  
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/PythonClass/classnotes$ head -25 tut1.py|tail -10        

3. Sometimes there are multiple man pages with the same name. How can you display them all?

AS:  using the command ls  /usr/share/man/man1 or 2,3,4,5....  if the  file or directory exists.
         adila@adila-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/PythonClass/classnotes$ ls /usr/share/man/man1

4. Make a new text file with your name, email address, what you're working for your project, plusa few things you'd like to learn in this couse. 
AS: I have created the file accordingly. 

5. Put your answer to the other tutorial question in to another text file.   
AS: The file has been created and all the answers to the tutorials have been added to text file. 

6. Make a gihub account and bush the repository into github.
 AS: I have created a github account accordingly
